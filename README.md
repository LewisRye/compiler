## Description
This repo contains my coursework for the Compilers module I studied while at university. It is a Gradle project that contains my implementations of a simple language code interpreter and a RISC-V code generator. This task was completed using Java and ANTLR. 

*My final grade for this coursework was **89/100***.

## Folder

**task1** - this folder contains the interpreter and grammar files.

**task2** - this folder contains the code generator and grammar files.

**task**{x}**tests** - these folders contain the test cases for their respective task.
